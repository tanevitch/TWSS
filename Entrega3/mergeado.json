            "reviewBody": "When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It&apos;s a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It&apos;s just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.",

            "name": "It&apos;s Not Battle Royale Because It&apos;s Not Supposed To Be",
            "reviewBody": "An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.\n\nCompared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn&apos;t help but wait for the &apos;but...&apos;. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.\n\nMany details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren&apos;t enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren&apos;t exciting or grand enough.\n\nBut in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.\n\nJennifer Lawrence didn&apos;t do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.\n\nEmotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it&apos;s partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it&apos;s because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.\n\nIt is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don&apos;t feel for the characters, you won&apos;t care about the film.",

            "reviewBody": "Mockingjay Part 2 serves as an entertaining, and somewhat satisfying finale of the strung out franchise. To be clear, the film is entertaining, and fans of the previous films will surely be happy, but just know the franchise clearly peaked with Catching Fire. The Franchise has since bloated it&apos;s final film for no other good reason, than to make extra money. All-in-all Mockingjay Part 2 is action packed, often entertaining, but falls victim to a somewhat weak script.\n\nMockingjay Part 2 gives us what Mockingjay Part 1 didn&apos;t, more action. Mockingjay Part 2 reverts back to the formula that made Catching Fire so great, while continuing the story of Mockingjay Part 1. By that I mean that the film gives fans a good mix of entertaining action sequences mixed with romance. However, at this point the romantic triangle feels so forced it&apos;s more of a distraction, than a sub-plot.\n\nThe action helps make the film entertaining, but what really makes the film is Jennifer Lawrence&apos;s commitment to anchoring the films. At the this point Lawrence has made Katniss Everdeen an extension of herself, to the point that she embodies the character. The grim tone, mixed with the meandering story make Mockingjay Part 2 entertaining from start to finish. However, the film does contain some major weaknesses, especially in it&apos;s script.\n\nWhile the story is full of twists and turns, it&apos;s still a little to bloated, as it would have been better if the studio had just made Mockingjay into 1 movie. The dialogue, is inconsistent and often too on-the-nose, with characters delivering out of place exposition. While the story has a very good plot twist near the end of the film, it doesn&apos;t handle it well, as the story just jumps all over the place in the end. The film also offered very little new substance to the franchise, in the end it would have been a great finale to a singular film.\n\nThrough all of it&apos;s issues, Mockingjay Part 2 helps the franchise come to a satisfying end. Mockingjay Part 2 improves on what Mockingjay Part 1 did, and is probably the better film, but still isn&apos;t as good as Catching Fire. The film is thoroughly entertaining, and is full of action despite it&apos;s script&apos;s weaknesses. In the end Mockingjay Part 2 is a good way to spend 2 hours, and is a good ending for the Hunger Games franchise.",
