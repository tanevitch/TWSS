            "reviewBody": "Whatever your thoughts are about Marvel you have to give them credit for their worldbuilding and character development. Wanda and Dr. Strange are both very unique and gray characters which makes them fun. The actors also do a great job portraying their characters.\n\nMarvel has never been this dark before. I&apos;m honestly surprised it hasn&apos;t got a higher age limit. But it&apos;s great with darker content. Marvel has for a long time felt too childish but this feels more real and got a stronger effect.\n\nThe multiverse is a very confusing subject and it can ruin movies, but it can also make them more fun. This movie did a good job not making it too confusing while also utilizing it and creating fun fanservice.\n\nLike the previous Doctor Strange movie, the visual effects are spectacular and breathtaking. There are some scenes which are not quite as believable but it doesn&apos;t take the viewer out of the movie.\n\nThe problem with these powerful magic characters is that they are too overpowered. There&apos;s a lot of plot armor, but it&apos;s almost impossible to avoid when you&apos;re playing with these powerful heroes. The magic can be a bit convoluted at times, but just remind yourself that it&apos;s a movie. Don&apos;t try poke holes at every plothole or stupid decision. Just have fun because it&apos;s a fun movie.",

Overall the movie ended up being a visually impressive gathering of missed opportunities.\n\nInstead of focusing on Newt, Dumbledore or Grindelwald the writers included screentime filling action for a number of side characters that does not influence the outcome at all. This only prevents the main story from progressing and (apart from the admittedly hilarious sidekick Kowalski) creates passages that you just have to endure.\n\nPlus the faceless army of Grindelwald&apos;s followers is so utterly incompetent that there never is any real danger to the heroes. They get shot down like puppets in a 15:1 strength ratio, are knocked out by Quidditch balls that wouldn&apos;t even cause a twelve-year-old any problems (see Harry Potter Part 2) and get beaten up by a Muggle with a suitcase.\n\nThe whole &quot;we meet at Hogwarts to make a plan to save the world&quot;-scene could have been replaced by a simple letter and wasn&apos;t any more than an excuse to include the castle in the trailer.",

Their feud during the film shows, in a very clever way, how directors usually deal with actors and actresses&apos; egos.\n\nGast√≥n Duprat and Mariano Cohn are truly the best filmakers Latin America can offer.

            "reviewBody": "Whatever your thoughts are about Marvel you have to give them credit for their worldbuilding and character development. Wanda and Dr. Strange are both very unique and gray characters which makes them fun. The actors also do a great job portraying their characters.\n\nMarvel has never been this dark before. I&apos;m honestly surprised it hasn&apos;t got a higher age limit. But it&apos;s great with darker content. Marvel has for a long time felt too childish but this feels more real and got a stronger effect.\n\nThe multiverse is a very confusing subject and it can ruin movies, but it can also make them more fun. This movie did a good job not making it too confusing while also utilizing it and creating fun fanservice.\n\nLike the previous Doctor Strange movie, the visual effects are spectacular and breathtaking. There are some scenes which are not quite as believable but it doesn&apos;t take the viewer out of the movie.\n\nThe problem with these powerful magic characters is that they are too overpowered. There&apos;s a lot of plot armor, but it&apos;s almost impossible to avoid when you&apos;re playing with these powerful heroes. The magic can be a bit convoluted at times, but just remind yourself that it&apos;s a movie. Don&apos;t try poke holes at every plothole or stupid decision. Just have fun because it&apos;s a fun movie.",

The main character here is Casey, played by Ethan Taylor, meant to be American but judging by his laughable accent he obviously isn&apos;t. I have marked this down as this is a pet hate of mine. Bad accent aside the Jack in question is reasonably creepy and there are a few half decent scares. Sadly the pace between kills is slow, some of the acting is of the wooden variety and the plot is predictable.",

            "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. It&apos;s not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that&apos;s because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, &quot;The best stories are rooted in reality.&quot;\n\nOscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a &apos;wink and a nod&apos; to Fabio). Loretta&apos;s love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she&apos;s required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.\n\nAfter their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He&apos;s read her latest book and needs her help in locating the &apos;Crown of Fire&apos; hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he&apos;s more than a pretty face. Loretta&apos;s stressed out literary agent Beth (Da&apos;Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).\n\nIt&apos;s regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt&apos;s cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta&apos;s rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It&apos;s mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (&quot;The Office&quot;).\n\nSandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It&apos;s an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It&apos;s meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It&apos;s totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.\n\nOpening in theaters on March 25, 2022.",
