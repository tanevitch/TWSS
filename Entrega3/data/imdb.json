But they obviously hired their cousin with a DSLR to shoot it. It is recorded with ambient light and sound. So it just looks and sounds flat. That seems to be the standard nowadays in these dime-a-dozen pre-professional horror movies. So if you are looking for stimulating atmosphere, there is an echo-y, brightly sunlit, nearly empty local historical society &quot;museum&quot; at the center of the film.\n\nIt is also very understated in a British way. The lead actor will wind up going on to better things. He is charmingly handsome; and it is only up for him from here. He just had a peculiarly muted accent. Most of the other cast was staid and just there.\n\nThe movie had some interesting ideas. A decent protagonist. A very well-designed villain. But horror-oriented plot, suspense and execution - not so much.",

            "reviewBody": "Going into this movie I was expecting it to be bad, borderline unbearable, largely due to the critic reviews. Oh boy did they get it wrong. This movie is far from as bad as they say, but I also would not describe it as anything spectacular. I feel that people are comparing it to other Marvel properties such as No Way Home and that is why reviews are so bad. That is unfair to compare it to such other films as Morbius is a fresh take on Marvel it feels. It is obvious that the delays ended up holding back what this movie could have been, perhaps what it truly should have been. It was enjoyable to watch from start to end. Loved the action sequences and CGI was beautiful. Takes a little bit to get through the more monotonous beginnings, but once you get to sink your teeth into the good parts, oh boy does it deliver. Some characters needed more development and the story what is a bit disjointed. Jared Leto is finally in a role that suits him, Morbius and Leto will only get better with more appearances. I rated it a 7/10 because a 7/10 to me means that it was an enjoyable movie regardless of whatever may be wrong with it, and I would gladly watch again. It is clear it would have been better suited as a rated R film, but with its current restrictions down to PG-13 I would say it is worth a watch at least. Don&apos;t expect to be blown away, except maybe by some of the action and CGI. I can see ratings from 5/10 to 7/10 being a fair range as everyones taste are different, but some of these other reviews I see are just taking it too far because it is not what Marvel is used to pushing.",

            "reviewBody": "I actually enjoyed this movie. But after hearing fans of the game talking about the weird casting. I have to take a couple of points off. I mean, you should always try to keep the fans happy. As well as bringing in newcomers.\n\nSo Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are totally wrong choises for these characters here. Holland in particular is really just the same as he is in Spiderman, and that&apos;s maybe what the money people wanted.\n\nOutside of the actors though, I was expecting this to be a CGI heavy mess. And though there is alot of CGI in its later parts. I still liked the action in the movie. The plane scene does feel like it belongs more in a game. But some of the realistic action, and the over the top finale were well done. You&apos;ll be entertained if you have no interest in the games I guess.",
