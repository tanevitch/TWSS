            "reviewBody": "I hesitate to say that a movie is perfect, especially after a first viewing. But gosh dang if this isn&apos;t close. And boy does it earn its beefy three hour runtime.\n\nBatman was always meant to be a film noir. And it&apos;s incredible to me that we haven&apos;t seen this before now. This is a mystery crime drama film that happens to feature Batman, and it&apos;s beautiful.\n\nIt&apos;s dripping with gritty atmosphere. Gotham is a bleak, decaying world in this film, and it has never been shown to this extent, nor with this level of visual prowess. Any shot in this movie would be considered the best shot in any other superhero movie. If this isn&apos;t at least in contention for every cinematography award, then awards will officially have lost all meaning to me.\n\nThe story is a puzzle, like all good crime mysteries, and the puzzle pieces place themselves together at a very satisfying rate. It&apos;s so efficiently paced, making three hours feel like far far less.\n\nBoasting one of the most intelligent scripts ever seen in a superhero movie, The Batman has minimal exposition and yet is still stuffed to the brim with subtle thematic depth and small but satisfying character arcs.\n\nBatman changes in his worldview throughout this movie, and I&apos;ve never seen it done this effectively in a Batman film. Things become personal to him in such a believable way. I felt it, even amidst the chaotic plot that&apos;s untangling itself around the character.\n\nMany will compare this film to The Dark Knight, but that&apos;s not fair. This is an entirely different beast, going on an completely different journey.\n\nThis is cinema, and it&apos;s cinema at one of its finest moments. Matt Reeves has cemented himself as one of the world&apos;s greatest working filmmakers, and I love that he&apos;s putting his talents to work in popular genres, elevating them to greater heights.",
